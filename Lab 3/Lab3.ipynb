    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "This data can be useful in determining the age and content rating of a video game with the goal of being able to classify a video game with the appropriate rating it would receive before entering the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains 1,895 unique video games that have already been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). The ESRB rates video games on the following scale: Rating Pending (RP), Early Childhood (EC), Everyone (E), Everyone 10+ (E 10+), Teen (T), Mature (M), and Adult (A). In this dataset, only games rated E, E 10+, T, and M are represented, so our classifier will be limited to these ratings. It also contains many important features that contribute to the certain rating a video game receives. These features are represented as binary values where 0 relates to the video game not having that characteristic, and 1 relates to the video game having that attribute. Some of the important features that will help classify the video game include Alcohol References, Blood and Gore, Crude Humor, Language, Nudity, Use of Drugs and Alcohol, Violence, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratings given to the video game determine age restrictions on who can purchase the game and also the intended audience of the video game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third-party Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our end goal is to be able to classify a video game to an ESRB rating based on whether the game has certain features or not, game developers would be interested in this classification algorithm. The algorithm would be useful to them because they would be able to have insight into the rating the game will receive before it is given its official rating by the ESRB. Therefore, game developers can tweak their game according to the intended audience of the game. For example, if a game is being developed for everyone but receives a rating of Teen from our algorithm, then the game developers could look at removing or reducing certain features of the game to bring down the rating. Furthermore, this algorithm will be useful in marketing the video game. By having an insight into the rating the game will receive by the ESRB, game developers can go ahead and begin marketing the video game to the audience of the rating it is classified as, while it still has not been officially rated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of this algorithm would be offline since there is no real time advantage of having the model deployed. Game developers will use the classification algorithm when they have a game ready to be rated or whenever they want to test what a certain combination of features of a game will be rated as.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measure of Success\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the classification algorithm is not for the official rating and only used as an insight into the official rating, we think that a success rate of 80% or greater would be considered useful for game developers. Having a success rate of greater than 80% will give game developers confidence in our algorithm that the rating it is classified as will most likely be the official rating it receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any misclassifications will not result in major concern to the game developers. The only real negative to a misclassification would be a waste in resources marketing to the wrong audience. Misclassifications are expected since we are trying to predict the decision of the ESRB. As long as misclassifications are minimal, game developers will still have faith in our classification algorithm.\n",

    "For this dataset, the columns are descriptors that go into the esrb rating for a video game. All those colums are binary data, where 1 represents a video game that has that particular attribute and 0 means it does not. Because the esrb rating was in string format, we encoded it so that the logistic regression would be able to successfully predict this categorical data. This is seen in the rating array created, that will be changed into a numpy array and transposed into a column so that it can be interpreted as the target data by the classifier. The values encoded were 0, 1, 2, and 3, representing E for everyone, E 10+, T for Teen, and M for Mature respectively. Additionally, we removed unnecessary information from the dataset that would not help our prediction, like the titles and console of the video games."

    "Through many trials, we determined that the BFGS Quasi-Newton Method was the most effective optimization for our data set. BFGS and Steepst Descent had similar accuracies, but BFGS was more time efficient, and it is adaptive, giving it the edge. While SGD is far less computational, it requires many iterations to get an accuracy close to BFGS. None of us are big statisticians, but we determined the L2 regularization was most beneficial because it is most useful when the data set has codependent features. This is very much the case for our data set since all ratings rely on the descriptors to classify them, some only requiring one or two of those descriptors to classify them as T vs ET or T vs M. The most optimal C was determined by exhaustively searching with BFGS and L2 normalization, and through the visualization it can be seen that a C of about .0001 is most optimal. Thus, our highest performing optimization is BFGS with L2 normalization with a C of .0001. It yields and accuracy of about 85% best case in 51.9 ms. This method of finding C, which is effectively data snooping, is unfortunately an easy way to overfit the data, since we are solely basing our optimal C on the training and test data from this data set. Any other attempted classification with other testing data used could be slightly askew because we overfit our classifier so much to this particular set of 1895 games."

    "## Differences between our implementation and SciKit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "From the data as presented above there are a few distinct differences. The first of these is the time differential. Averaged over 100 runs our implementation executes in about a tenth of a second whereas SciKit-Learn gets around two hundreths of a second, meaning their implementation runs around five times faster than ours. The next difference is the accuracy. Our implementation averages around 82.5% whereas SciKit-Learn averages around 86%. Additionally, our implementation has about a 3% spread throughout all the iterations, where SciKit-Learn gets pretty much the same every time. This precision can be seen in the graph above, where SciKit-Learn's box plot is basically non existent because of how close its accuracy was each iteration. Thus, while our accuracy and prediction time are decent, SciKit-Learn's implementation really shows us up with its impressive execution time, better accuracy, and higher precision."

    "# Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "We would recommend utilizing the SciKit-Learn implementation for a deployed machine learning model. This comes down to two main factors being accuracy and precision. In both of these measures SciKit-Learn beats our implementation as was spoken about in the last section. While SciKit-Learn's implementation does execute faster than our implementation, our prediction problem does not really require a fast execution time since it will be mainly for offline analysis. Thus, it does not really matter SciKit-Learn is better in time performance. However, it does outperform our implementation in terms of accuracy by three to four percent. Additionally, it is incredibly precise each iteration, which is more optimal than our more varied results. Now it is not really a fair fight because SciKit-Learn has liblinear, but we can safely say that after comparing results SciKit-Learn is the optimal choice for deployment in this prediction problem. However, if the game developers do not really care about a few percentage points in accuracy, our implementation is a safe alternative."
